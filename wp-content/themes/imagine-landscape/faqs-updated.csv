What makes Imagine Landscape different from a typical landscape company?
We’re not just a service company—we are landscape designers, plant lovers, garden builders, and outdoor enthusiasts. Every member of our team is trained to see your yard as a living system with potential for beauty, structure, and seasonal interest. We bring a deep horticultural knowledge base to every property we touch.

Why does horticulture matter in landscape maintenance and design?
Because a yard isn’t just hardscape and grass—it’s alive. When you understand how plants grow, what they need, and how they interact with their environment, you can create landscapes that thrive with less input and stay beautiful across all seasons. That’s the difference between a property that looks fine and one that turns heads.

What kind of horticultural expertise does your team have?
Our team includes experienced professionals with backgrounds in plant science, arboriculture, soil health, irrigation efficiency, and organic lawn care. We understand plant zones, microclimates, bloom sequencing, pruning cycles, and integrated pest management. Whether it’s diagnosing a struggling tree or building a pollinator garden, we know how to do it right.

What’s a “4-Season Garden” and why do you talk about it so much?
A 4-Season Garden is one that has something beautiful, structural, or colorful to offer year-round. We design landscapes with layers: spring bulbs, summer perennials, fall foliage, and winter textures from bark, evergreens, and grasses. It’s our signature approach—and our obsession.

Can Imagine Landscape help me with plant selection?
Absolutely. We design and build planting plans based on your property’s conditions (sun, shade, soil, water access) and your aesthetic goals. Whether you want bold color, waterwise natives, an edible landscape, or a lush formal garden—we curate plant palettes that thrive.

Do you use sustainable landscaping practices?
Yes. We believe that beauty and sustainability go hand-in-hand. We prioritize drought-tolerant plants, soil-building practices, water-efficient irrigation systems, and organic inputs whenever possible. We’re advocates for smart gardening and long-term landscape health.

Why does your team care so much about gardens?
Because we believe that outdoor spaces should bring peace, beauty, and pride to the people who live in them. We’ve seen firsthand how a well-cared-for garden can transform a home and how a thoughtful planting can anchor a community. We’re in this business because we love it—and it shows.

What if I don’t know anything about plants? Can you still help me?
That’s what we’re here for. Whether you're new to gardening or a seasoned enthusiast, we guide you every step of the way—from plant education and selection to maintenance strategies and seasonal care. No jargon, no judgment—just great results.

How do I start working with Imagine Landscape on a project or garden?
Get in touch through our website or by phone. We’ll set up a consultation, assess your goals and site conditions, and build a plan that reflects your vision, your lifestyle, and your property’s natural potential.

What is Imagine Landscape’s approach to landscape design?
Our design process is grounded in creativity, technical expertise, and a deep understanding of plants and outdoor spaces. We don’t just draw up plans — we collaborate with you to create a space that’s functional, beautiful, and tailored to how you live. Every design reflects our belief that a great landscape should feel natural, intentional, and timeless.

How does the design process work?
We start with a consultation where we walk your property, listen to your ideas, and ask smart questions to understand your goals. From there:
Site Mapping & Analysis – We assess sun patterns, drainage, soil conditions, and existing features.
Concept Development – We generate initial layout and material concepts.
Detailed Design & Plant Palette – We refine the layout, select plants, materials, and finishes.
Final Proposal – We provide a detailed scope of work and budget.
You’ll have clear visuals and line-item pricing so you can make confident decisions.

How much does a design cost?
Our full design package for a standard ¼-acre lot starts at $1,600. This includes the consultation, site measurement, layout planning, planting plan, and itemized proposal. Larger or more complex properties may require custom pricing.

What sets Imagine’s designs apart?
We are known for:
Strong seasonal structure – Our gardens shine year-round.
Natural flow and balance – Transitions between zones, thoughtful proportions, and usability are baked in from the start.
Attention to soil and microclimates – We match plants to the exact conditions they’ll thrive in.
Tailored design – No two yards are the same. We create outdoor spaces that reflect your style, not just ours.

Can you design for low-water or xeriscape landscapes?
Yes, and we love doing it. We specialize in water-conscious design that still feels lush and beautiful. We combine native and adapted plants with efficient drip irrigation and well-placed hardscape features to create thriving, low-maintenance landscapes that don’t sacrifice style.

Do I have to install everything at once?
Not at all. We can break your design into phases based on budget, seasonal timing, or your priorities. Many of our clients appreciate a master plan with a clear roadmap, even if it’s implemented over time.

Do you offer 3D renderings or sketches?
For most residential projects, we provide scaled 2D site plans with material references and plant images. For select large or high-end projects, 3D renderings are available upon request. We make sure every client clearly understands the layout and design vision before any work begins.

Can you incorporate outdoor living features like patios, fire pits, lighting, or garden structures?
Yes — seamlessly. Our designs integrate all elements of outdoor living, including:
Patios and walkways
Seat walls, pergolas, and fencing
Outdoor kitchens and fire elements
Lighting systems
Raised planters and edible gardens
We design with both aesthetics and construction best practices in mind.

What’s the difference between a remodel and a new build?
A remodel updates or transforms an existing landscape—often to improve curb appeal, fix dated or failing systems, or align the yard with your current lifestyle. A new build starts from the ground up, typically after home construction or a full tear-out. In both cases, our approach is comprehensive: we assess your whole property to create a cohesive, functional, and beautiful landscape.

What makes Imagine Landscape different when it comes to installations?
We combine technical precision, creative design, and construction expertise to deliver truly elevated outdoor spaces. Our team doesn’t cut corners—we:
Build drainage systems that protect your home and foundation
Retrofit and design irrigation systems specific to plant zones and sun exposure
Account for and work safely around utility lines, meters, and valves
Use correct layering and compaction for weed prevention and long-term stability
Deliver color-balanced, four-season planting schemes that actually thrive
Integrate lighting, patios, walkways, and gathering spaces in thoughtful ways
Our goal is to blend beauty with performance—so your landscape not only looks amazing on day one, but gets better with time.

Can you build outdoor living spaces like patios, fire pits, and gathering areas?
Yes—and this is where we shine. Whether you're looking for a clean and modern patio, a cozy fire pit area, or a multi-functional entertaining zone, we design and build impactful outdoor living spaces that feel like natural extensions of your home. Every space is built with intention, usability, and long-term enjoyment in mind.

Do you handle utility work and complicated site conditions?
Yes. We’re highly experienced at navigating around gas lines, electrical conduit, irrigation mains, and water laterals. Before any digging, we coordinate Blue Stakes utility locates and carefully plan around existing infrastructure. We also resolve grade and drainage challenges, tight access, and tree root zones with skill and care.

What’s included in a full landscape remodel or build?
Our full-service approach includes:
Grading, base prep, and drainage control
Complete irrigation installation or renovation
Hardscaping (patios, walkways, walls, steps)
Lighting and electrical planning
Planting plans tailored to Utah’s climate and soils
Mulch, decorative gravel, steel edging, and other finish materials
Each project is designed for performance, beauty, and ease of maintenance.

Can I phase the work over time?
Yes. Many clients phase their projects—starting with structural elements like patios and retaining walls, followed by planting, lighting, and finishing touches. We plan every project so that each phase builds toward the full vision, and nothing has to be undone or redone later.

How long does a full install take?
Depending on scope, details, custom fabrications and intricacy, most installs take 2–6 weeks from ground break to completion. We’ll give you a realistic schedule and timeline at the proposal stage—and communicate clearly throughout.

Why did you start Imagine Landscape?
We founded Imagine Landscape because we saw a gap in the industry:
Missed deadlines
Lack of delivering a project in completed state
Poor communication
Inconsistent quality
Lack of accountability
There was too often no clear point of contact, no follow-up, and no sense of pride in the finished product. We believed there was a better way to deliver landscape services—where clients feel heard, cared for, and impressed by the outcome. So we built a company around that belief.

What’s different about the Imagine Landscape experience?
Our entire operation is built on delivering your project or service “with a bow on it”—finished, polished, and professionally managed from start to finish. That philosophy shows up in everything we do:
Dedicated Client Service Managers: Every active job has a field-based manager responsible for oversight, communication, and quality. You won’t be left guessing who to call.
Clear Timelines & Expectations: We set realistic schedules, communicate proactively, and follow through. If anything changes, you’ll know right away.
Polished Deliverables: From the final cleanup to neatly cut edges and swept walkways, we don’t leave until it’s right. Our crews are trained to treat your home like their own.
Professionalism at Every Touchpoint: From our field crews to our office support, you’ll feel the difference in responsiveness, clarity, and care.

What does "With a Bow on It" really mean?
It means we deliver a product or service that is complete, clean, and exceeding expectations—not half-done, not sloppy, and never leaving you to chase us down. Whether it’s a weekly mow or a full property remodel, we treat every job as a reflection of our brand and your trust in us.

How do I communicate with the team during my project?
You’ll have a dedicated point of contact during any service or project. For most ongoing maintenance clients, this is a Client Service Manager who visits the property regularly and checks in with you. For design/build clients, it’s a combination of your designer and project lead. We offer text updates, email summaries, and in-person walkthroughsto make communication easy and consistent.

Do you offer follow-up or ongoing care after a project is complete?
Yes—we believe long-term success matters just as much as day-one impact. After your install, we’ll walk the property with you, review care instructions, and offer a plan for maintenance or seasonal care. Many of our design/build clients choose to continue with Premier or VIP maintenance plans to keep their investment thriving.

We schedule a property walkthrough
Review your current scope and pain points
Provide a clear, itemized proposal
Set a start date and communication protocol
We work hard to make onboarding easy and hassle-free, whether you’re switching from another provider or starting from scratch.

Our goal is to keep your site safe, accessible, and compliant during all winter conditions—no delays, no missed events.

What’s included in your snow removal services?
Typical snow contracts include:

How does your dispatch system work?
We monitor weather forecasts in real time and automatically dispatch crews based on your contract specifications (e.g., 1" trigger or zero-tolerance). You won’t need to call—we’re already preparing. Routes are assigned in advance so your property is covered without delay.

Do you offer seasonal contracts or per-push pricing?
Yes—we offer two pricing structures:
Seasonal Contract – A flat monthly fee from November through March. This is ideal for clients who want budget certainty and guaranteed coverage regardless of snowfall totals.
Per-Push Pricing – Pay only when snow service is needed. This option requires a monthly retainer to guarantee equipment availability, route assignment, and dispatch readiness throughout the season.

Why is a monthly retainer required for per-push clients?
Per-push clients still require:
Reserved equipment and labor capacity
Ongoing monitoring of their site
Route inclusion and scheduling priority
The retainer ensures you’re on our storm map and your property gets serviced promptly—even if it’s a light winter. Without it, we cannot commit resources to a property during peak storm events.

What kind of equipment do you use?
We maintain a fleet of:
Snowplow trucks
Sidewalk clearing machines
Skid steers with pushers
Ice melt and salt spreaders
All equipment is staged and ready before storms, ensuring timely and effective service.
